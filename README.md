# Cinderella Activity Plugin for Moodle

Todos:
* Replace filepicker with filechooser or save the uploaded file in local fs, not in "mdl_cinderella" table, so that it can be reloaded into the draft area of the filechooser when editing and does not have to be reuploaded every time.
* Adding xAPI functionality. Idealy reading from the events provided by the cinderella file. Also maybe implement already existing xAPI Plugin.
